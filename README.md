# ChooseYourOwnAdventure

This is Kath's choose your own adventure game! In it, you are a common student, battling teachers and attempting to get money any way you can to pay off your inevitable debts.
In it, you choose rooms, collect money by chance, but largely by defeating your teachers in battles. To win, all you need to do is survive until the end! You heal a little between each room, but only a little! You'll need to stay strategic with your defending skills. Luckily, unlike the basic teachers, English teachers only muster up an attack once every three turns, and Math teachers every four, but both of them are more deadly for their preparation. Good luck, brave student!
